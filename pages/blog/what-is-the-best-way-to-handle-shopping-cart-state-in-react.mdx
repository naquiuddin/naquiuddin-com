The first option is now easier using the new **context api**. It is made to
solve exactly this kind of use case. Let me explain you how to implement this
using it.

## What is Context

[React's documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) say this about
**Context**:

> Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having
> to pass props down manually at every level.

The docs also say

> Context is designed to share data that can be considered global for a tree of
> React components

This means you can use context to maintain authenticated user details, user
access permissions, theme configs etc.

In our shopping cart's use case we need to keep shopping cart almost everywhere
in an e-commerce website. We need to maintain its state and update it in
whichever route we currently are. We also need this state and update function in
for add to cart button component. Apart from these two places we also need to
edit cart's products in checkout page. All these scenarios tell us that using
**Context** is the right thing for this scenario.

## How to use Context

Context can simply be created like this, write code as given below:

    const defaultCartState = {
    	products: [],
    	updateProducts: () => [],
    }
    const CartContext = React.CreateContext(defaultCartState);
    export default CartContext;

In above code I first created a default value for context. It has zero products
that's why empty array and a function called `updateProducts` that just returns
an empty array, which means it does nothing. You will soon see how I pass actual
values and function into the context which we can reuse everywhere we need it.

Now in order to use the CartContext for components deep inside a Container /
Page component you have to wrap it with a _Context's Provider_ Component.

Every context object comes with a Provider component. It makes the components
that are children to it subscribe to changes made to the context, which means
whenever you change your context value the provider automatically update its
child components with the new changed value. Here is how you would use it. Let's
say you need to read CartContext inside product listing page then you first wrap
the Provider component to the parent component where you want to maintain the
the cart state. It could be your Page or App component.

    import React from "react";
    import CartContext from "./cartContext";
    import Home from "./pages/home";

    const HomePage = (props) => {
    	const [products, updateProducts] = useState([]);
    	const CartState = {
    		products,
    		updateProducts
    	}
    	return (
    		<CartContext.Provider value={CartState}>
    			<Home />
    		</CartContext.Provider>
    	)
    }

    export default HomePage;

In above code I imported CartContext and used `useState` that returns `products`
array and a function `updateProducts` to update the same `products` array. I
created an object using these values and passing it as value to CartContext
Provider's value prop. This `CartState` object can be consumed wherever you use
the context.

Also in above code I am using `<Home/>` component. Inside it let's say I have 2
components like `<Nav/>` and `<ProductsList/>`.

- `<Nav/>` has `<Cart/>` component inside it and
- `<ProductsList/>` that has `<AddToCart/>` button component inside.

```
import Nav from "../components/nav";
import ProductsList from "../components/productsList";

const Home = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Nav />
            <ProductsList />
        </div>
    );
};

export default Home;
```

Observe in the code above I am not passing any props related to cart in both
components.

Now let's say inside `<Nav/>` I have `<Cart/>` component that needs `CartState`
from context. In order to use that I write the code as given below.

```
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import Cart from "./cart";
import CartContext from "../CartContext";
const Nav = (props) => {
const CartState = useContext(CartContext);
    return (
        <nav>
            <NavLinks>
            <Cart
                products={cartState.products}
                updateProducts= {cartState.}
            />
        </nav>
    );
}
```

I am using `useContext` hook and passing the `CartContext` into it, which
returns the value `CartState` which we passed earlier in our `<Page/>`
component.

Now using the `products` array you can calculate total amount, count of products
etc and whenever you remove a product you can add the update products using
`updateProducts` function in `<Cart/>` component.

Like above example we can pass products and updateProducts function to
`<AddToProducts/>` component inside `<ProductsList/>` component.

And because we are using `<Provider>` at the top level whenever the `products`
array changes using `updateProducts()` inside the context the components that
uses the context automatically updates.
